                <div class="term-definition">A fundamental quantum property where a system exists in multiple states simultaneously until measured. A qubit in superposition is both 0 and 1 at the same time, with specific probability amplitudes for each. Measurement forces the system to "choose" one state.</div>

                <div class="term-definition">A prediction of classical physics that hot objects should emit infinite energy at high frequencies, which contradicted observations. Resolved by Planck's quantum hypothesis that energy comes in discrete packets, launching the quantum revolution.</div>
