You mentioned you already have 3 posts - let's add them!


==========================================================
HOW TO ADD A NEW BLOG POST (15 MINUTES PER POST)
==========================================================

OVERVIEW:
For each new article, you'll:
1. Copy the template file
2. Fill in your content
3. Add metadata to blog-data.json
4. Upload both files to GitHub

DETAILED WALKTHROUGH:

STEP 1: Prepare Your Article
-----------------------------
Before you start, have ready:
□ Article title
□ Your content (1,000-3,000 words recommended)
□ Category (theory, consciousness, experiments, philosophy, mathematics)
□ Brief excerpt (1-2 sentences)
□ Estimated read time (approx. 200 words = 1 minute)
□ Tags (3-5 relevant keywords)
□ Icon/emoji (optional, for visual appeal)

STEP 2: Create URL Slug
------------------------
Convert your title to a URL-friendly slug:

Example: "Information as the Foundation of Reality"
Becomes: "information-foundation-reality"

Rules for slugs:
- All lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters
- Keep it short but descriptive

STEP 3: Copy and Customize the Template
---------------------------------------
1. Download blog-post-template.html
2. Save it with your slug name: blog-post-[SLUG].html
   Example: blog-post-information-foundation-reality.html

3. Open in a text editor and replace these placeholders:

In the <head> section:
   [ARTICLE EXCERPT] → Your 1-2 sentence excerpt
   [AUTHOR NAME] → Your name
   [ARTICLE TITLE] → Your article title

In the article header:
   [CATEGORY] → theory, consciousness, etc.
   [ARTICLE TITLE] → Your title
   [ICON] → Choose an emoji (🌌 🧠 ⚛️ 🔬 💭 📐)
   [AUTHOR NAME] → Your name
   [DATE] → October 24, 2025 (or your publish date)
   [READ TIME] → Estimated minutes

In the author box:
   [AUTHOR BIO] → Brief bio (1-2 sentences)

In the article content section:
   Replace ALL placeholder text with your actual article content

STEP 4: Write Your Article Content
----------------------------------
In the <article class="article-content"> section:

Structure your article with:
- <h2> for major sections
- <h3> for subsections
- <p> for paragraphs
- <blockquote> for important quotes
- <div class="callout"> for key insights
- <ul> or <ol> for lists
- <strong> for emphasis
- <em> for secondary emphasis

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
```html
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Your opening paragraph...</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Describe the issue or question...</p>

<blockquote>
"A relevant quote or key statement"
</blockquote>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Present your ideas...</p>

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">💡 Key Insight</div>
    <p>Your important takeaway...</p>
</div>

<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>What does this mean?...</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Summarize and inspire further thought...</p>
```

STEP 5: Update Tags Section
---------------------------
Replace the example tags with your relevant tags:
```html
<a href="#" class="tag">#your-tag-1</a>
<a href="#" class="tag">#your-tag-2</a>
<a href="#" class="tag">#your-tag-3</a>
```

STEP 6: Add to blog-data.json
-----------------------------
1. Open blog-data.json in GitHub
2. Click pencil icon (Edit)
3. Add your post to the "posts" array:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "title": "Your Article Title",
  "slug": "your-article-slug",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "author_type": "owner",
  "date": "2025-10-24",
  "category": "theory",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
  "excerpt": "Brief 1-2 sentence description...",
  "read_time": 8,
  "featured": false,
  "icon": "🌌",
  "status": "published"
}
```

IMPORTANT: 
- Give each post a unique ID (increment from the last post)
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
- Set featured: true for only ONE post at a time
- Match the slug exactly to your filename

4. Click "Commit changes"

STEP 7: Upload Article to GitHub
--------------------------------
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Upload your blog-post-[SLUG].html file
