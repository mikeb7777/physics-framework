            <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
            <p>This work presents a theoretical framework for understanding reality, consciousness, and computation. The content represents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theoretical speculation</strong> based on current scientific understanding</li>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important Notice About Predictions:</strong> This work includes specific experimental predictions. These are theoretical proposals, not established facts.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Nature of Predictions</h3>
            <p>Experimental predictions in this work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are derived from theoretical frameworks</li>
                <li>Await experimental validation or falsification</li>
                <li>May be revised based on new data</li>
                <li>Should not be assumed correct until independently verified</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Safety</h3>
            <p>Any experimental work inspired by this theory must follow proper scientific protocols, institutional review boards, safety procedures, and ethical guidelines. The author bears no responsibility for experimental activities conducted by others.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Philosophical and Ethical Content</h2>
            
            <h3>Personal Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Discussions of consciousness, meaning, value, and ethics represent one philosophical perspective. Readers may hold different views and are encouraged to think independently.</p>

            <h3>No Claim to Absolute Truth</h3>
            <p>While the work uses definitive language for clarity, all frameworks presented are <strong>models</strong> - useful approximations that may capture aspects of reality but should not be mistaken for complete or final truth.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Ethical conclusions drawn from the theoretical framework are proposals for consideration, not prescriptions for behavior. Individuals must make their own ethical decisions based on their values, circumstances, and judgment.</p>

            <h2>10. Publication Dates and Priority</h2>
            
            <h3>Version Tracking</h3>
            <p>All versions of this work are maintained with publication timestamps to establish:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When specific theories were proposed</li>
                <li>When predictions were made</li>

            <h3>Scientific Priority</h3>
            <p>Publication dates establish <strong>scientific priority</strong> for claims made in this work. If experimental validation later confirms predictions, the timestamp provides evidence of when the prediction was made.</p>
